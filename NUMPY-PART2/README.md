# NumPy Exercises â€“ CodÃ©dex

This Jupyter Notebook contains practical exercises using **NumPy**, focusing on array operations, mathematical computations, reshaping, and basic data analysis. These exercises are part of **CodÃ©dex** challenges aimed at strengthening Python and data science skills.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

1. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - Converting values using array multiplication.
   - Example: Converting tallest building heights from feet to meters.

2. **NumPy Functions**
   - Common functions like `.min()`, `.max()`, `.sum()`, and `np.average()`.

3. **Shape and Reshape**
   - Understanding `.shape` of arrays.
   - Reshaping arrays using `.reshape()` to change dimensions.

4. **Real-World Exercises**
   - Tracking weekly steps and performing min, max, and average calculations.
   - Splitting monthly data into weekly data for analysis.

5. **Array Creation with `.arange()`**
   - Example: Predicting the years Halley's Comet will appear using `np.arange()`.

6. **Titanic Data Analysis**
   - Analyze passenger data:
     - Shape of the dataset.
     - Average age of passengers.
     - Identifying the oldest and youngest passengers.
     - Calculating the percentage of survivors.

## What Youâ€™ll Learn
